# PyTorch CAPTCHA Recognition

This solution uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch to recognize 5-character alphanumeric CAPTCHAs.

## Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Train the model:
```bash
python train_pytorch_model.py
```

This will:
- Load images from the `base/` directory (using filenames as labels)
- Train a CNN model for 50 epochs
- Save the best model as `captcha_model_best.pth`
- Generate training history plots

## Usage

### Command-line prediction:
```bash
python predict_captcha.py path/to/image.png
```

### PHP integration:
```bash
php fast_pytorch.php
```

## Model Architecture

The CNN consists of:
- 3 convolutional layers (32, 64, 128 filters)
- MaxPooling and Dropout for regularization
- 2 fully connected layers (512, 256 units)
- 5 output heads (one per character position)
- Each head outputs 36 classes (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)

## Performance

The model typically achieves:
- 95%+ character-level accuracy
- 80%+ sequence-level accuracy (all 5 characters correct)
